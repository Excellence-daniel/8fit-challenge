## Task Summary

The task was completed in two days, in which most of the time was spent trying to create a pixel perfect replica of the landing animations provided, and screens designs.

Redux was used for state management and persists data locally.

Having tried to create the aforementioned animations with the react-native `Animated` API and had several issues, partly due to the limited experience I've had with the API; I decided to use an npm module - [FluidTransitions](https://github.com/fram-x/FluidTransitions). Even though the module is hightly customizable, I had to combine both react-native `Animated` and `FluidTransitions` to create a near copy of the animation.


## Issues

No tangible issue.
